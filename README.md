I'm not very good with names so I figured it would be useful to create a userscript to mark up the posts made by bots. This script dims the bot posts from the list your list. It's pretty good to visualise the extent of the bot infestation too. Works on all 3 pages and updates with the autoscroll. May also cancel the auto-ignore prompts if possible.

## Install

Install this on a Firefox with Greasemonkey by opening the user script or on Chrome by downloading it and dragging the file into the Extensions page. 

## Configuration

You need to go to the new "HL Tools Settings" item within the Settings menu to add a bot list file, like a public text file from Dropbox:
